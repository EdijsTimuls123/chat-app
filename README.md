Websocket + node.js + react.js

I did not have that much free time to implement everything, this will be my excuse I just hope it is enough to qualify for the next interview part.

First time working with websockets It took me few days to kinda understand how they work and what is the purpose of them.

I think If I had more time I would make it perfect! With the frontend having proper routing and so on. I think I have covered everything that is asked in requirements, I got the idea of
how it works. Was a nice experience at the end of the day anyways! :)


HAVE ADDED DEMO PICTURE AS WELL!
